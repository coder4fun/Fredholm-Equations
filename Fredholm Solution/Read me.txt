The code provides the solution of the Fredholm integral equation of second kind using haar wavelets.
The equation parameters can be changed as mentioned below.

Run the code by running the 'solution.m' file.

Input parameters:

x-function: To change the 'x-function' go to x_function.m file and change it.

kernel: To change the 'kernel-function' go to kernel.m file and change it.

k: To vary the value of 'k' goto 'solution.m' file and change the value of k.

Exact solution: If the exact solution is known, add a .m file with the function containing the exact solution 
		and replace the existing function ( exact_solution1(2) in the solution.m file )
