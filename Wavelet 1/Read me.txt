The code gives the graphical approximation of a function using the haar wavelets.

Run the code by running the Wavelet1.m file

Input parameters:

kmin,kmax,j - given at runtime

input function: Change the input function in input_function.m file

Exact solution: If the exact solution is known, add a .m file with the function containing the exact solution 
		and replace the existing function ( exact_solution in the wavelet1.m file )
